## Highlight 
Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. 24 And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me,  (Acts 25:23–24, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Ac25.23-24)

## Explain
 Paul is being brought before King Agrippa. He has already seen several other Roman leaders, now a final one before he is sent to Rome. 

Jesus had called Paul to preach to Gentiles and Kings:
But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. 16 For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” (Acts 9:15–16, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Ac9.15-16)
## Act
When Paul was first called, and then going on his missionary journies, he probably didn't think this was how he would be talking to Gentiles and Kings. God's plan sometimes doesn't look the same way we would think. 

We must continue to trust God even when it seems like His plan isn't working how we would expect. 

## Respond
Seek to know God's plan for my life. Reject my thoughts and view of how I think God will work, and look for how God ***is*** working.
