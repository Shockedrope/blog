The phrase "Don't let the sun go down on your anger" comes from Ephesians 4:26, where the Apostle Paul writes:

> "Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger" (Ephesians 4:26, ESV).

Here's what this verse is teaching us:

- **It's okay to feel anger:** Paul acknowledges that anger itself isn't sinful. It's a natural human emotion.
- **But be careful not to sin in your anger:** Anger can easily lead to harmful actions or words, so we need to control how we respond.
- **Resolve conflicts quickly:** The phrase "do not let the sun go down on your anger" encourages us to deal with our anger before the day endsâ€”to seek reconciliation and peace rather than letting bitterness grow.
- **Peace and unity matter:** Holding on to anger can damage relationships and hinder our spiritual walk.

This verse reminds us to be honest about our feelings but also responsible in managing them. It's about forgiveness, patience, and restoring harmony.
