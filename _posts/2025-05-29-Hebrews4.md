## Highlight 
Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. (Hebrews 4:11, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Heb4.11) 

## Explain
 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, 10 for whoever has entered God’s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.  (Hebrews 4:9–10, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Heb4.9-10)

For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13 And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.  (Hebrews 4:12–13, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Heb4.12-13)

Rest in God. From the context of the passage it seems to indicate that even spiritual growth needs rest. We cannot continue to grow without rest. 

## Act
Recognize patterns of growth and rest in my life. 

## Respond
Be calm and rest in God when it seems that I am not growing spiritually. Prepare for the next season of growth.
