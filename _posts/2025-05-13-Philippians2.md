## Highlight 
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. (Philippians 2:3, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Php2.3)

## Explain
Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (Philippians 2:4–8, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Php2.4-8)

## Act
Humble yourself as Christ humbled Himself to the point of death by His own creation. We should not think of ourselves better than anyone person, but we all are sinners (Rom. 3:23). In striving to be Christ like we should be humble servants to one another. 

## Respond
Pray that my pride will diminish and I will learn to be humble. Consciously be aware of how I am treating others, and not looking down or coming across as rude or haughty. Look for ways to serve others at my expense.
