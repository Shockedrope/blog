## Highlight 
Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. (Colossians 3:5, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Col3.5)

But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. 9 Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.  (Colossians 3:8–10, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Col3.8-10)

## Explain
 Paul is explaining how we should act as Christians, not depending on people group, but all that have faith in Christ. 

## Act
Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, 13 bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 17 ==And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.==  (Colossians 3:12–17, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Col3.12-17)

Key verse in this passage is Col. 3:17. Everything we do should be for Jesus. At work, at home, at church, on vacation, everything we do should be done as if we are doing it for Jesus. 
## Respond
Keep Jesus at the front of my mind. Everything I do should be for Him. Even in the small things, do it as if He asked you to do it for Him. We are but stewards with what He has given us. (Matt. 25:14-30, 1Cor. 6:19-20)
