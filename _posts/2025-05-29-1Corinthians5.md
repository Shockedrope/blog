## Highlight 
6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? 7 Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
[The Holy Bible: English Standard Version](https://ref.ly/res/LLS:1.0.710/2019-04-30T20:46:24Z/5032326?len=233) (Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles, 2016), 1 Co 5:6–7.

## Explain
 8 Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— 10 not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. 11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. 12 For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? 13 God judges those outside. “**Purge the evil person from among you.**”
[The Holy Bible: English Standard Version](https://ref.ly/res/LLS:1.0.710/2019-04-30T20:46:24Z/5032560?len=805) (Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles, 2016), 1 Co 5:8–13.

“If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, 2 and the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’ 3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the Lord your God is testing you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 4 You shall walk after the Lord your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and hold fast to him. 5 But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, to make you leave the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk. **So you shall purge the evil from your midst.**
[The Holy Bible: English Standard Version](https://ref.ly/res/LLS:1.0.710/2019-04-30T20:46:24Z/1794738?len=960) (Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles, 2016), Dt 13:1–5.
## Act
Do not let sin linger and fester. Only a little yeast makes the whole loaf rise, so only a little sin can damage the whole body.

Recognize sin, ask for forgiveness, turn away from that sin. 

Daily turn to God to have him reveal sin in your life, that you may be sanctified.

## Respond
Pray and read the Bible regularly/daily, so that the Holy Spirit can work in your life and reveal truth to you. When the Holy Spirit leads, do not fight or resist, but obey.
