## Highlight 
but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.  (Hebrews 1:2, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Heb1.2)

## Explain
The message of Salvation was brought by the Son. The message and teachings of what the Son said are more significant than what prophets of old, or angels have said. 

Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. 2 For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, 3 how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, 4 while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.  (Hebrews 2:1–4, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Heb2.1-4)

## Act
Don't take for granted The Word of God. Know and understand what Jesus taught. Read your Bible. Memorize scripture. Let The Word shape you into the likeness of Christ. 

Don't get caught in mystic thoughts, chasing after angels or demons. We have the Words from God, and we should listen and obey. 

## Respond
Pray to understand Jesus teachings. Study His teachings more carefully. Have a reverence for the Bible.
