## Highlight 
No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, 21 fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. (Romans 4:20–21, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Ro4.20-21)

## Explain
 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb. (Romans 4:19, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.Ro4.19)

He believed in what God had told him, even though he would never see the end fulfilled. 

## Act
I should trust God more because I can read His Word and see the promises fulfilled. I can also see God working in my life, and in the lives around me. 

## Respond
What are the promises from God? I should know those, and belive/trust that God will fulfill His promise.
