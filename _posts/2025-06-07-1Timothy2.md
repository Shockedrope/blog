## Highlight 
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. ([1 Timothy 2:1–2](https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.1Ti2.1-2), ESV)

## Explain
This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. 7 For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.  (1 Timothy 2:3–7, ESV, https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:1.0.710?ref=BibleESV.1Ti2.3-7)

## Act
God desires that all people be saved. Praying for all people will help us to have compassion on others. This will help that we keep what is important top of mind... that ALL people be saved. 

## Respond
Make a prayer list, and pray for people around you consistently. Start with family, church, work, town, state, country, world. Pray for all people that they would see the light of God's glory, and trust in Christ alone to save them from their sins.
